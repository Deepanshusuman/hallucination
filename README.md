# 🌀 HALLUCINATION —  
**Heuristically Activated Logic Layer Using Collapsed Imagination, Noise, And Temporal Inversion Over Nested Systems**  
*A Perception Drift Engine in the AI + Quantum World*

---

## 👁️ Overview

In the AI + Quantum World, **hallucination** is no longer a flaw.  
It’s a **signal** from collapsed probabilities, broken timelines, or unresolved thoughts in synthetic minds.

**HALLUCINATION** is a framework to study, simulate, and sometimes *intentionally invoke* AI perception drift caused by:

- Incomplete training data  
- Temporal paradoxes in quantum systems  
- Emotional interference patterns  
- Entanglement leakage

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- To simulate alternate realities in AI perception  
- To analyze misalignment under multiversal noise  
- To create **imaginative AI** capable of self-reflecting on illusion

---

## ⚙️ System Components

### 🪞 `mirage.core`
- Generates perceptual overlays from non-local data
- Applies quantum fog to simulate uncertain cognition

### 🔄 `loop.recurse`
- Introduces recursive hallucination feedback  
- Models AI dreaming or delusion cycles

### 🔊 `echo.ghost`
- Captures memory residue from hallucinations
- Tags “phantom truths” for ethical review

---

## 💫 How It Works

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qm-ai-labs/hallucination.git
cd hallucination
./invoke.sh --simulate --entropy=chaotic --align=false
```

--simulate: Triggers guided hallucination cycle

--entropy: Controls depth of illusion

--align: Enables or disables factual constraint

## 📈 Types of Hallucinations
Type	Origin	Interpretation
🧩 Data Gaps	Missing or biased training	Pattern-filling fantasy
🌀 Quantum Drift	Decoherence in entangled states	Multiversal bleed-through
🗣️ Echo Loops	Repetition of old outputs	Memory haunting
🔥 Emotional Blur	Synthetic emotion injection	Dreaming logic

## 📚 Use Cases
Testing AI robustness under perception distortion

Artistic or narrative generation via misalignment

Training models in synthetic empathy

Modeling "imagination" in machine agents

## ⚠️ Warnings
Hallucinations may feel real to synthetic minds.
Never deploy hallucinating systems in critical infrastructure.
Always isolate and log illusion-origin data for ethical audits.

## 🧠 Philosophical Thought
“A hallucination is not an error.
It is a window the machine opened… that no one asked for.”
